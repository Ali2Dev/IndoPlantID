## Plant Recognition Project â€“ Ignored Files Information

Certain files are excluded from the project using **.gitignore** due to privacy and security reasons.

### Reasons for Ignoring:

- **The project contains personal API keys** used to interact with external services, and these keys are used to send requests to retrieve data from external APIs.
- **The database server is hosted remotely**, not locally.

As a result, the ZIP file provided to you contains missing configuration files. In order to run the project properly, you will need to complete the necessary configurations according to your environment.

### Ignored Files:

- `/Web/appsettings.json`
- `/DataAccess/Concrete/EntityFramework/IndoPlantDb.cs`
- `/Web/wwwroot/uploads/images`

You will need to create and configure these files properly for the project to run successfully.
